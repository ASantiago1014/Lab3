This is a simple Word Unscramble game made with an Android app development tool and programmed using Java. This program displays a welcoming message to the user, followed by one of the secret words that are randomly chosen from an array. The word is scrambled by splitting the string into an array of characters and using the .shuffle() method. Then the shuffled letters are then added to a string that is then displayed to the user. The user then must input their guess as to what the shuffled word originally spells. The program works by taking the input of each character that is guessed, one by one, and adds the partial guess to a separate view box, letter by letter. If the userâ€™s guess is not the correct letter, the input box is cleared and their number of incorrect guesses is increased, which is also displayed to the user.
